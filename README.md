# Logistic-Regression-Cat-Identifier
Built a logistic cat classifier in neural network architecture using NumPy. This model was trained on 209 examples.

## Objectives
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    - Initializing parameters
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
### Results
The model acheived a 70% accuracy score on a test set of 50 examples.
